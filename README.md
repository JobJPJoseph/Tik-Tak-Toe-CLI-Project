# Tik-Tak-Toe CLI Project

## Phase 1
Our first task is to create a player.js file and spec file to go with it. We need to make sure the 'readline' is working as intended.

We need to create a player class that accepts an object that represents the 'readline' object.
The class will have two instance methods: getCoordinate and validateCoordinate.
Also need to create tests for them.

## Phase 2
Our next task is to create a cpu class that emulates the player class. This time the cpu will grab a random coordinate from the availableCoordinates and return it. No need to validate it or format it.
